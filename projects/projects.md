## Project suggestions 

* an embedded domain-specific language for image transformations, optimized according to a set of laws.  
  For example, you might coalesce adjacent rotations or resizings, or go further and compile down to efficient linear algebra operations.

* an embedded domain-specific language for music.  
  For example, you might build something along the lines of Szamozvancev and Gale's EDSL described in ([Well-typed music does not sound wrong, Haskell 2017](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3122964)), but using non-classical (e.g. Jazz) harmony rules.
