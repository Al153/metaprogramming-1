# Scheme

This lecture uses [Chez Scheme](https://cisco.github.io/ChezScheme/).

You can experiment with the evaluator in a `scheme` session, by:
- running `scheme` interactively
- `(load "evl.scm")`
- `(repl)`
- Try `1`.
- Try `(lambda (x) x)`.
- Try the examples in `exs.scm`.
- Now you can copy paste the entire `evl.scm` file, and run another level of `(repl)`.
